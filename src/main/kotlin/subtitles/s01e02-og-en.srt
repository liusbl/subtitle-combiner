1
00:00:06,174 --> 00:00:12,305
Over a century ago, beings that
prey on humans suddenly appeared.

2
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:22,190
Their absolutely overwhelming strength

3
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:26,236
quickly pushed humanity to
the brink of extinction.

4
00:00:31,032 --> 00:00:37,330
The surviving humans constructed
three walls: Maria, Rose, and Sina,

5
00:00:37,539 --> 00:00:40,875
which brought them a century of peace.

6
00:00:41,084 --> 00:00:42,502
However...

7
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:04,149
<i>Unknown are the names
of the flowers that have been trampled</i>

8
00:01:04,357 --> 00:01:09,612
<i>Birds have fallen to the earth
and long for the wind</i>

9
00:01:09,821 --> 00:01:14,701
<i>Prayers won't solve anything</i>

10
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:20,039
<i>Only the will to fight
can change the here and now!</i>

11
00:01:20,248 --> 00:01:25,336
<i>O pigs who laugh at the resolve
to walk over corpses to move forward</i>

12
00:01:25,545 --> 00:01:27,881
<i>Livestock complacency? False prosperity?</i>

13
00:01:28,089 --> 00:01:30,759
<i>Give us the freedom of dying,
starving wolves!</i>

14
00:01:30,967 --> 00:01:36,139
<i>The humiliation of being caged
is what triggers us to fight back</i>

15
00:01:36,347 --> 00:01:41,436
<i>We hunters slaughter prey
beyond the castle walls,</i>

16
00:01:41,644 --> 00:01:46,649
<i>consumed with surging bloodlust,</i>

17
00:01:46,858 --> 00:01:53,782
<i>as our crimson bows and arrows
pierce scarlet holes into the twilight</i>

18
00:02:34,572 --> 00:02:42,247
Till that time I had been a wretched soul,
and wholly giv'n to greed!

19
00:02:42,455 --> 00:02:49,128
Now, as thou see'st,
I'm punished for it here!

20
00:02:49,712 --> 00:02:52,715
What avarice doth

21
00:02:52,924 --> 00:02:58,221
is here made manifest,
in this purgation of converted souls!

22
00:02:59,681 --> 00:03:06,354
Nor hath this Mount a penalty more bitter!

23
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,119
Stop!

24
00:03:21,327 --> 00:03:22,620
Let me go!

25
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:25,415
O Avarice!

26
00:03:25,623 --> 00:03:29,043
Thou hast to thyself so drawn my race,

27
00:03:29,252 --> 00:03:34,215
that ev'n for its own flesh it careth not!

28
00:03:34,424 --> 00:03:37,969
What more canst thou do with us?!

29
00:03:42,223 --> 00:03:45,602
O Avarice! Thou hast to thyself--

30
00:03:59,157 --> 00:04:00,783
Eren! What are you doing?!

31
00:04:00,992 --> 00:04:03,786
We were so close to saving Mom!

32
00:04:03,995 --> 00:04:05,997
Why couldn't you mind your own business?!

33
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:10,418
--We were so close to saving her!
--Knock it off, dammit!

34
00:04:11,044 --> 00:04:12,462
Eren!

35
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:18,968
Eren.

36
00:04:21,638 --> 00:04:24,849
You couldn't save your mother

37
00:04:25,058 --> 00:04:27,226
because you lacked the strength.

38
00:04:30,063 --> 00:04:31,689
And I...

39
00:04:32,815 --> 00:04:36,903
I couldn't stand up to the Titan...

40
00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:40,031
...because I lacked the courage!

41
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,335
I'm sorry.

42
00:05:03,388 --> 00:05:05,682
It's happened again...

43
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:23,282
Hurry! To the inner gate!

44
00:05:23,491 --> 00:05:27,328
Escape aboard the boats there!

45
00:05:28,037 --> 00:05:31,666
Hurry! Before you get eaten!

46
00:05:44,345 --> 00:05:48,933
City districts like Shiganshina that
stick out in vital spots along the wall

47
00:05:49,142 --> 00:05:56,065
serve to attract the Titans and streamline
security costs and troop numbers.

48
00:05:56,274 --> 00:05:59,652
Performing true to its role as a Titan target,

49
00:05:59,861 --> 00:06:06,534
Shiganshina had but one inner gate
through which its citizens could flee.

50
00:06:09,454 --> 00:06:11,122
Discard your belongings!

51
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:13,958
Let as many people on as possible!

52
00:06:18,546 --> 00:06:20,423
Sit, Armin.

53
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:24,677
But Eren and Mikasa still aren't here.

54
00:06:24,886 --> 00:06:26,721
There they are!

55
00:06:28,598 --> 00:06:30,016
Eren?

56
00:06:31,851 --> 00:06:34,562
Just let him be for now.

57
00:06:34,771 --> 00:06:38,232
The poor thing.
How very traumatized he must be...

58
00:06:38,441 --> 00:06:39,859
Huh?

59
00:06:41,694 --> 00:06:44,405
What are you dawdling for?!
Hurry the hell up!

60
00:06:44,614 --> 00:06:46,574
Get those cannons loaded!

61
00:06:54,082 --> 00:06:55,249
Hurry!

62
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:57,376
They're closing in!

63
00:07:11,516 --> 00:07:14,560
This can't be for real...!

64
00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:18,272
Please, God...
Please, God... Please, God...

65
00:07:18,481 --> 00:07:20,108
Hey!

66
00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:22,485
Hey! What are you doing?!

67
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:24,779
It's at full capacity! It has to leave!

68
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:28,324
No! Please! At least let our children on!

69
00:07:28,533 --> 00:07:30,243
I'm sorry, but we can't!

70
00:07:30,451 --> 00:07:32,078
Get going!

71
00:07:35,331 --> 00:07:37,166
--Let us on!
--Let us on!

72
00:07:53,724 --> 00:07:55,977
You idiot! What are you aiming at?!

73
00:07:56,185 --> 00:08:00,314
B-But, Sir, these aren't
accurate enough to aim with!

74
00:08:00,523 --> 00:08:04,777
I don't give a crap!
Get 'em reloaded at once!

75
00:08:04,986 --> 00:08:06,487
It's no use!

76
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:13,870
The gate's closing...!

77
00:08:14,078 --> 00:08:16,289
Retreat! We're gonna get left behind!

78
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:17,915
Hey!

79
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,711
Don't shut it! Hold on a little longer!

80
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,505
There are still lots of people in there!

81
00:08:24,714 --> 00:08:26,507
If the Titans get through,

82
00:08:26,716 --> 00:08:30,052
the town being overrun
will be the least of our worries!

83
00:08:30,261 --> 00:08:33,973
All of humankind will be forced
to withdraw behind the next wall!

84
00:08:34,182 --> 00:08:38,853
But that's no reason to
leave <i>these</i> people to die!

85
00:08:39,061 --> 00:08:39,896
Shut it! Hurry!

86
00:08:40,104 --> 00:08:41,647
The Titans are coming!

87
00:08:42,565 --> 00:08:44,609
Close the gate at once!

88
00:08:46,319 --> 00:08:47,737
Stop!

89
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,698
Hey!

90
00:09:28,736 --> 00:09:30,238
What the...?

91
00:09:31,697 --> 00:09:33,449
It's...!

92
00:09:33,658 --> 00:09:35,076
Fire!

93
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,961
--What?!
--No effect?!

94
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,048
It's...!

95
00:09:50,883 --> 00:09:54,011
It's coming! Retreat!

96
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:57,056
A Titan's coming! It's charging this way!

97
00:09:57,265 --> 00:10:00,101
Hurry! Shut the gate!

98
00:10:34,927 --> 00:10:36,554
The gate...

99
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:10,212
Within hours of the fall of Shiganshina
on the south side of Wall Maria,

100
00:11:10,421 --> 00:11:16,802
news of the incident had reached
every city inside human territory.

101
00:11:17,011 --> 00:11:21,682
Is it true the Titans
have overrun Shiganshina?!

102
00:11:21,891 --> 00:11:23,309
I can't believe this!

103
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:26,479
The walls have held strong
for a century! Why now?!

104
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:28,564
Whether we believe it or not,

105
00:11:28,773 --> 00:11:31,776
the fact is that refugees have
fled here by boat!

106
00:11:31,984 --> 00:11:34,779
Reports say there are five hundred on board.

107
00:11:34,987 --> 00:11:38,783
The question is if Shiganshina
is all that was affected...

108
00:11:38,991 --> 00:11:44,330
But, surely they couldn't have
gotten through Wall Maria as well?

109
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:48,125
In any event,

110
00:11:48,334 --> 00:11:50,669
we must contact the central
government and request instructions.

111
00:11:50,878 --> 00:11:55,883
This crisis is far too much
for us to handle on our own.

112
00:11:56,092 --> 00:11:57,593
I'm sorry to interrupt!

113
00:11:57,802 --> 00:11:59,678
A courier horse has just arrived!

114
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:04,517
Titans have breached
Wall Maria and entered its interior!

115
00:12:12,066 --> 00:12:13,692
It's over...

116
00:12:15,027 --> 00:12:17,071
It's all over...

117
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,409
The Titans are going
to devour humanity again...

118
00:12:21,617 --> 00:12:23,285
This is the end...?

119
00:12:24,829 --> 00:12:30,543
I'll... never see
that house... ever again...

120
00:12:33,337 --> 00:12:34,755
Why...?!

121
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:39,969
Why'd I argue for no reason like that?!
Why was that all I could do?!

122
00:12:40,177 --> 00:12:42,388
And now Mom's gone!

123
00:12:43,556 --> 00:12:45,850
She's never coming back!

124
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:49,937
Why...?!

125
00:12:50,146 --> 00:12:53,649
Because you lacked the strength.

126
00:12:55,651 --> 00:12:59,238
It's because I'm weak...
Because humans are weak...

127
00:12:59,447 --> 00:13:02,908
ls crying the only
thing the weak can do?!

128
00:13:17,298 --> 00:13:20,217
I'm... going to...

129
00:13:20,426 --> 00:13:21,260
Eren.

130
00:13:21,469 --> 00:13:23,429
What's gotten into you, Eren?

131
00:13:24,388 --> 00:13:25,806
Eren...

132
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:28,684
...drive them out!

133
00:13:30,144 --> 00:13:32,146
I'm going to drive out...

134
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:35,232
...every last one from this world!

135
00:13:36,025 --> 00:13:37,443
Eren...

136
00:13:43,407 --> 00:13:47,536
The same year, the central
government made the decision

137
00:13:47,745 --> 00:13:51,624
to withdraw all of humanity's
domain behind Wall Rose.

138
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:57,379
An estimated 10,000 people
were eaten by Titans during this time.

139
00:13:58,923 --> 00:13:59,965
Eren...

140
00:14:00,174 --> 00:14:01,175
Carla...

141
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:02,885
Mikasa...

142
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:05,095
Please be all right!

143
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:09,016
Eren!

144
00:14:09,767 --> 00:14:10,768
Eren!

145
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,311
Eren!

146
00:14:12,937 --> 00:14:14,146
Eren!

147
00:14:14,355 --> 00:14:15,147
Dad!

148
00:14:15,356 --> 00:14:16,774
Stop, Dad!

149
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:20,110
What are you trying to do?!

150
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:21,695
Just give me your arm!

151
00:14:21,904 --> 00:14:23,197
No!

152
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:26,075
Mom's death has made you go crazy!

153
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:27,117
Eren!

154
00:14:27,326 --> 00:14:29,620
Let go, Dad!

155
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:30,829
It's for...

156
00:14:31,038 --> 00:14:31,914
...your own sake!

157
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:33,541
What are you talking about?!

158
00:14:33,749 --> 00:14:36,377
Listen! Don't forget the key!

159
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:39,088
You <i>must</i> reach it!

160
00:14:39,296 --> 00:14:43,300
Until... you learn...
the truth someday...!

161
00:14:51,517 --> 00:14:53,852
Eren. Are you okay?

162
00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:55,896
You were having a nightmare.

163
00:14:56,814 --> 00:14:59,900
I feel like I just saw Dad...

164
00:15:00,109 --> 00:15:02,736
No. You were dreaming.

165
00:15:03,654 --> 00:15:05,072
Oh...

166
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:10,703
Let's go.

167
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:13,664
They said they're going to hand out food.

168
00:15:18,377 --> 00:15:21,630
Apparently this was their food storehouse.

169
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,759
They've gathered all the boat refugees here.

170
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,564
--Hey! Get in line, will ya?!
--Shut up!

171
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:41,734
I ain't eaten anything since last night!

172
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:45,738
We can't say we've survived just yet.

173
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:46,739
Eren!

174
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:48,365
Mikasa!

175
00:15:48,574 --> 00:15:49,992
Armin...

176
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,370
Here! Just in time!

177
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:57,291
My grandpa got us some
by saying it was for children!

178
00:15:57,499 --> 00:15:59,126
Thank you.

179
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:06,634
What's his problem?

180
00:16:06,842 --> 00:16:08,302
You can't blame him.

181
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:11,680
There's probably not
enough food to go around.

182
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:14,224
And that's an entire day's worth.

183
00:16:14,433 --> 00:16:16,268
There are just too many refugees.

184
00:16:16,477 --> 00:16:18,437
There was already
a food shortage going on,

185
00:16:18,646 --> 00:16:21,982
plus the people here aren't treated
as well as citizens on the outer wall.

186
00:16:22,191 --> 00:16:23,317
--This is mine!
--Shut up!

187
00:16:23,525 --> 00:16:26,987
Why should we hafta give our
food to some lousy outsiders?

188
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:30,324
If the Titans got through the wall,

189
00:16:30,532 --> 00:16:33,994
they could've at least eaten
some more people, if you ask me!

190
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:38,290
Eren!

191
00:16:38,499 --> 00:16:42,252
This is just gonna make
the food shortage even worse.

192
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:43,879
Oww!

193
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:47,633
What the hell?! You damn kid!

194
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,679
You don't know what it's like!

195
00:16:51,887 --> 00:16:54,181
You've never even seen it!

196
00:16:55,224 --> 00:16:59,103
You've never seen
what the Titans do to people!

197
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:00,938
Shut up!

198
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:02,272
I apologize!

199
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:04,942
He's just hungry and irritable!

200
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:08,862
That's why he so rudely
lashed out at an adult...

201
00:17:09,071 --> 00:17:12,366
I'm very sorry!

202
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:15,994
Man...

203
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:21,333
It's 'cause of <i>us</i> that you guys
aren't starving to death, you know!

204
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:24,753
Even you kids oughta be thankful to us!

205
00:17:24,962 --> 00:17:26,338
Of course!

206
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:27,965
Damn...

207
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:31,510
I refuse to let <i>them</i> take care of me.

208
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,806
I'm going back. To Wall Maria!

209
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:38,726
I'm going to destroy every last Titan!

210
00:17:38,934 --> 00:17:39,852
Eren...

211
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,104
You're not being serious, are you?

212
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:43,856
I'm serious!

213
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:47,860
I'm not like those guys who do
nothing but act tough inside the walls!

214
00:17:48,944 --> 00:17:50,779
I don't need this crap!

215
00:17:52,406 --> 00:17:54,533
Eren! You'll starve to death!

216
00:17:54,742 --> 00:17:56,785
Doesn't it bother you at all?!

217
00:17:56,994 --> 00:17:59,872
It's because we take everyone's
charity that we can't beat the Titans!

218
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,291
It's impossible!
There is no beating them!

219
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:05,169
All we can do is live inside the walls!

220
00:18:05,377 --> 00:18:08,338
If we try anything, we'll die!
Just like my mom and dad!

221
00:18:08,547 --> 00:18:12,092
So you're just gonna grovel to them then?!
That's not shameful to you?!

222
00:18:12,301 --> 00:18:14,470
There's... There's nothing
we can do for now!

223
00:18:14,678 --> 00:18:16,305
That's just an excuse!

224
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:19,600
If you wanna live like
livestock forever, go ahead!

225
00:18:19,808 --> 00:18:21,643
You wimp!

226
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:26,774
Mikasa...

227
00:18:35,491 --> 00:18:39,286
If Armin's a wimp, then so are we.

228
00:18:39,495 --> 00:18:43,207
Whether it was running
from the Titans or fleeing the town,

229
00:18:43,415 --> 00:18:47,002
we didn't manage anything on our own.

230
00:18:47,211 --> 00:18:50,047
We even had help finding food today.

231
00:18:50,255 --> 00:18:52,466
There's no way such powerless people

232
00:18:52,674 --> 00:18:56,178
can defeat even a
single one of those Titans.

233
00:18:57,346 --> 00:19:00,182
Staying alive is what matters most.

234
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:02,643
Just like your mother said.

235
00:19:08,357 --> 00:19:09,650
Mikasa!

236
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:12,611
You have to eat and stay alive.

237
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:15,572
I <i>won't</i> let you starve to death.

238
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:29,795
Several days later,
the throngs of refugees

239
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:34,591
were tasked with cultivating
the wastelands to secure food.

240
00:19:36,552 --> 00:19:39,346
However, a food shortage was unavoidable.

241
00:19:39,555 --> 00:19:41,765
So, in the following year of 846,

242
00:19:41,974 --> 00:19:45,018
the central government sent a
multitude of refugees on a mission

243
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:48,814
in the name of retaking Wall Maria.

244
00:19:56,572 --> 00:20:00,284
Of the 250,000 sent--

245
00:20:00,492 --> 00:20:02,786
nearly 20% of the population--

246
00:20:02,995 --> 00:20:06,748
not even 200 survived.

247
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:10,502
Although it wasn't much,
their sacrifices did improve

248
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:15,048
the food shortage situation
for the rest of the population.

249
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:30,314
It's all the Titans' fault.

250
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:33,734
If we could just subdue them,

251
00:20:33,942 --> 00:20:37,779
our place in the world could be ours again.

252
00:20:39,031 --> 00:20:40,741
Armin.

253
00:20:40,949 --> 00:20:43,952
I'm going to apply for the Cadets next year.

254
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:49,875
I'm going to gain the
strength to fight the Titans!

255
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:54,212
Me too...

256
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:55,422
Armin?!

257
00:20:55,631 --> 00:20:57,049
Me too!

258
00:20:58,091 --> 00:20:59,593
I will, too.

259
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:00,719
Mikasa...!

260
00:21:00,928 --> 00:21:05,265
You don't need to! You said yourself
staying alive is what's important!

261
00:21:05,474 --> 00:21:10,312
Yes. That's why I'm doing it;
so <i>you</i> won't die.

262
00:21:14,024 --> 00:21:17,319
All right. The three of us, then.

263
00:21:24,326 --> 00:21:29,539
The 104th Cadet Corps Class
entrance ceremony will now begin!

264
00:21:29,748 --> 00:21:34,628
You have the misfortune of having me,
Keith Sadies, as your commandant!

265
00:21:34,836 --> 00:21:37,297
I do <i>not</i> welcome you warmly!

266
00:21:37,506 --> 00:21:40,592
In your current state, you'd
be nothing but food for the Titans!

267
00:21:40,801 --> 00:21:44,221
You're mere livestock!
You're <i>less</i> than livestock!

268
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:49,810
Over the next three years,
we're going to train you worthless nothings

269
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:52,813
and teach you how to fight Titans!

270
00:21:53,021 --> 00:21:56,441
Three years from now, when you
come face-to-face with the Titans,

271
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:58,485
will you still be fodder for them?!

272
00:21:58,694 --> 00:22:02,197
Will you serve as an honorable
barrier that protects the king?!

273
00:22:02,406 --> 00:22:06,535
Or will you be a glorious soldier
for humanity that drives the Titans out!

274
00:22:06,743 --> 00:22:08,453
It's up to <i>you</i> to decide!

275
00:22:09,788 --> 00:22:12,582
Yes. I'll be one.

276
00:22:13,917 --> 00:22:17,629
I'll drive out every last Titan!

277
00:22:40,569 --> 00:22:45,282
<i>Your dreams are where your heart is</i>

278
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:51,538
<i>They're more fragile than life itself</i>

279
00:22:51,747 --> 00:22:56,251
<i>Over and over you cast them aside,
only to find more</i>

280
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:02,966
<i>Now, rest in peace</i>

281
00:23:03,175 --> 00:23:14,061
<i>Pounding impulses defile the things we wish for</i>

282
00:23:14,269 --> 00:23:24,571
<i>and the more we forget
the more we remember again</i>

283
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:30,535
<i>In this beautiful, cruel world</i>

284
00:23:30,744 --> 00:23:35,832
<i>all I can do is ask why we're still alive</i>

285
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:41,463
<i>Oh, with our strength--and our weakness--</i>

286
00:23:41,671 --> 00:23:47,010
<i>what are we going to protect if there's no sense</i>

287
00:23:47,219 --> 00:23:51,807
<i>to anything anymore?</i>

288
00:23:57,771 --> 00:23:59,898
He fails as a soldier.

289
00:24:00,107 --> 00:24:04,402
Eren joins the Cadets,
vowing revenge against the Titans,

290
00:24:04,611 --> 00:24:10,700
but his failure at basic training
comes as a harsh reality.
