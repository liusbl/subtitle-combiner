1
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:08,375
(Armin) More than 100 years ago...

2
00:00:09,075 --> 00:00:11,678
A natural enemy of humanity has appeared

3
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:21,688
between them and humans
There is an overwhelming difference in power...

Four
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:25,725
Humanity was soon on the brink of extinction.

Five
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,766
The surviving humans

6
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:33,700
Maria

7
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:34,667
Rose

8
00:00:34,734 --> 00:00:37,370
Build Sheena's three walls

9
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:40,640
There, we achieved 100 years of peace.

Ten
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:41,775
but…

11
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:49,416
♪～

12
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:15,768
～♪

13
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:36,422
(Teacher) Until that time...

14
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:41,461
I am a completely greedy soul with no happiness.

15
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:44,631
Now as you see

16
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:47,867
For this reason he is punished here.

17
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:51,838
What greed does

18
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:57,911
We regret the sins of our souls
Appears to be pure

19
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:05,418
In this mountain in the first place
There is no punishment more bitter than this!

20
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:08,421
(Female) Ha ha ha...

twenty one
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:14,294
Hah... Ah!

twenty two
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:19,899
Ahhhhhhhhh

twenty three
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:22,402
Stop it! Let go!

twenty four
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:24,938
(Teacher) Oh, greed!

twenty five
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:28,308
Thou shalt draw my lineage unto thee.

26
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:28,875
(man shouts)

27
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,843
(man shouts)

28
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,843
Ono gave meat to this.

29
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:31,511
(man shouts)

30
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:33,513
As soon as he is forgotten,

31
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:37,283
What else should I do?

32
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:44,290
Ah, greed! My bloodline-

33
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:44,991
For you...

34
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:58,771
(Ellen) Ugh!
(Hannes) Ah!

35
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:00,707
Ellen what...

36
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:03,643
(Ellen) Almost there
I could have saved my mother!

37
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,979
Don't do unnecessary things!

38
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,480
I'll see my mother soon...

39
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:09,482
(Hannes) Don't worry!

40
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:10,516
(Eren) Ugh...

41
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:11,784
(Mikasa) Eren!

42
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:18,291
(Hannes) Ellen

43
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:24,397
You couldn't save your mother.

44
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:26,733
Because you didn't have the power

45
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:29,402
this!

46
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:30,903
(Hannes) I-

47
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:35,775
The reason I didn't stand up to the giant was...

48
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:38,878
Because I didn't have the courage!

49
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:51,391
Sorry

50
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:58,665
(Eren's sobs)

51
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:05,571
(Mikasa) Ah... again.

52
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:15,915
(Male) Wow!

53
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:17,984
Wow!

54
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,388
(Fugo) Hurry! Go to the inner gate!

55
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:27,093
on a ship anchored
Escape from Shiganshina!

56
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:31,064
hurry up! You'll be eaten alive!

57
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:48,848
(aluminum) located at key points on the wall
Districts that stand out like Shiganshina

58
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:51,384
Become a decoy to attract giants

59
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:55,421
Security costs and troops
played a role in suppressing

60
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:57,890
As per its role-

61
00:05:57,957 --> 00:06:01,928
Targeted by giants
Residents of Shiganshina Ward

62
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:05,598
From just one inner gate
I had no choice but to escape

63
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:10,937
(garrison)
Everyone, throw away your bags!

64
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:12,739
Carry as many people as possible!

65
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:20,480
(Armin's grandfather)
Armin, sit down.

66
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,416
(Aluminum)
Eren and Mikasa are still...

67
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:25,585
Ah, it's here!

68
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:26,986
oh…

69
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:29,122
Ellen?

70
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:33,593
Leave him alone now

71
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:37,663
Poor thing
It doesn't look like that...

72
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:39,165
picture?

73
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:41,501
(Male) Ugh, wow!

74
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:44,437
(Fugo) How long have you been fidgeting?
hurry up!

75
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:46,072
What happened to the bullet?

76
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:57,183
Hurry! It's already in front of me!

77
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:14,167
(Male) That's a lie... something like this...

78
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:17,470
(Female) God... God...

79
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:20,173
(Residents murmur)

80
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:22,542
(Male) Hey! What are you doing?

81
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,677
(Garrison) It's full. Let's set sail.

82
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:27,980
(Female) Like that
Please give me a ride, even if it's just the kids

83
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:29,982
I'm sorry, but I can't.

84
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:30,917
Set sail!

85
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,557
(Female) Let me ride!
(Male) Get on it!

86
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:38,991
(Male) Uh... ugh.

87
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:40,760
(Male) Huh! Wow!

88
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,562
(Sound of a man falling into the sea)

89
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:45,465
(sound of cannon firing)

90
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,701
(sound of cannon firing)

91
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:56,042
(Fugo) You idiot, where are you aiming?

92
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:56,943
(Soldier 1) But!

93
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,179
This guy has the precision to hit the target.
There isn't!

94
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,082
(Fugo) Now, such a promise is
It doesn't matter.

95
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,784
Hurry up and load the next bullet!

96
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:05,918
(Soldier 1) It's impossible!

97
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:10,189
ah…

98
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,726
(Soldier 2) The gate will close.

99
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:16,095
(Soldier 3) Retreat! You'll be left behind!

100
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,029
Hey!

101
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,267
(Hannes) Don't close it, wait a little longer.

102
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:24,136
There's still a lot of people left inside.

103
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:26,606
(Soldier 4) If you break through this gate...

104
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:30,042
One city becomes a giant
I'm not talking about being occupied.

105
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:33,946
Until the next wall, the area of human activity
Move back!

106
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:37,616
That's why the person in front of me
There's no reason to let it die

107
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:39,885
(Soldier 2) Close quickly!

108
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:41,053
(Soldier 3) The giant is coming!

109
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,289
Close the gate, hurry!

110
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:47,159
Away!

111
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:50,096
Wow... oh!

112
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:51,631
(Titan's footsteps)
Ha!

113
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:55,234
(Titan's footsteps)

114
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:56,168
Ha…

115
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:24,964
Hey!

116
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:29,602
What…

117
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:32,672
that person

118
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,674
Huh, shoot!

119
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:43,215
What!

120
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,584
(Soldier 4) It doesn't work.

121
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:49,889
Ah... no! Hurry up and get to the gate!

122
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,059
(Fugo) It's coming! Evacuate!

one two three
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:56,762
A giant is coming! It's coming!

124
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:59,599
Hurry up to the gate!

125
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:36,035
(Hannes) The gate...

126
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:40,973
(Sound of giant breathing)

127
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:06,832
(Armin) South of Wall Maria

128
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:09,435
A few hours after the fall of Shiganshina District

129
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:11,737
The news is-

130
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:16,008
Every city in the human realm
spread in an instant

131
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:18,210
(Member 1) Is it true?

132
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:21,213
To Shiganshina
What do you mean the giants invaded?

133
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:23,249
(Member 1) I can't believe it...

134
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:26,052
Why did he change the wall after 100 years?

135
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:31,257
(Committee 2) Believe it or not.
There are people who actually escaped by boat.

136
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:34,827
Reports say he has 500 people on board.

137
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:38,230
(Chairman) The question is whether Shiganshina was the only one.

138
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:40,166
(Committee 3) But...

139
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:43,869
I think it's Wall Maria
There's no way they'll invade the inland area...

140
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:47,840
anyway-

141
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,443
Contact the center and ask for instructions

142
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:55,181
This kind of emergency
We can't deal with it alone.

143
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:57,116
(sound of door opening)
(Garrison) Excuse me!

144
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,151
Hayama just now...

145
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:04,156
Wall Maria is destroyed
It is said that a giant has invaded the inland area!

146
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:13,099
Is the end…

147
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:15,968
(Male) It's over...

148
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:20,406
Humanity will also be devoured by giants.

149
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:22,441
(Eren) It's over...

150
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:26,779
Already in that house of his...

151
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:29,482
I can never go back

152
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:34,053
Why-

153
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:38,357
Until the end, it's just a stupid verbal quarrel
I couldn't do it.

154
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:41,527
There's no more mother

155
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:44,997
she's nowhere to be found

156
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,168
Why!

157
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:53,172
(Hannes) Because you didn't have the strength.

158
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:58,811
Because I... humans are weak...

159
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:02,081
Do weak people have no choice but to cry?

160
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:19,064
(Eren) Those guys are from this world...

161
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,033
Ellen?

162
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,835
(Armin) What happened? Ellen

163
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:25,004
Ellen?

164
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:28,207
I'll destroy!

165
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:31,477
From this world-

166
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:34,313
Not one left!

167
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:36,815
Ellen...

168
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:47,193
(Armin) This year, the central government
The field of human activity-

169
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:51,096
To Wall Rose
decided to retreat

170
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:54,366
The person who was eaten by the giant the other day...

171
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:56,602
Approximately 10,000

172
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:02,208
(Grisha) Eren Carla Mikasa

173
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:04,376
Please stay safe

174
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:12,284
(Grisha) Ellen Ellen

175
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:13,619
Ellen!

176
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,855
(Ellen) Dad! Stop it, dad!

177
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,358
What are you trying to do?

178
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:21,527
(Grisha) Okay, just put your arm out.

179
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,028
(Ellen) I don't like it!

180
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:26,098
Her father died because her mother died.
It's gone crazy!

181
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:27,266
Ellen!

182
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,268
(Grisha) Let me go, dad!

183
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,503
(Grisha) It's for you!

184
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:33,505
(Ellen) What are you talking about?

185
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:35,608
(Grisha) Listen, don't forget your keys.

186
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:38,510
you have to reach

187
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:40,946
Someday I'll know the truth

188
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,314
Until then!

189
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:46,018
(bell sound)
Ha!

190
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:55,160
(Mikasa) Eren, are you okay?
I was bored

191
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:59,565
(Ellen) I think I met my father...

192
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:02,201
No way, it's a dream

193
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:05,204
(Ellen) I guess so...

194
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:09,541
(Mikasa) Let's go

195
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:12,578
There's food rationing

196
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:21,120
This used to be a food store.

197
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:24,590
Those who came by boat
He's all gathered here.

198
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:37,436
(Male) Hey, line him up properly!

199
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:38,370
(Male) Noise!

200
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:41,273
This is from her home
I haven't eaten anything!

201
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:44,643
we are still
I didn't survive.

202
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:47,379
(Armin) Eren Mikasa

203
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:49,348
(Eren) Armin

204
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,252
(Armin) Look, you're on time.

205
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:57,222
Because grandpa is for the child
she kept it for me

206
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,190
thank you

207
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:03,395
(Staff) Check

208
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,532
What? that person

209
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:08,067
I can't help it

210
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,203
We probably don't have enough rations for this number of people.

211
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,672
That's one day's worth

212
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:16,308
There are too many refugees

213
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,410
There's a lack of food to begin with...

214
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:22,114
those who live on the outside
You know it's not important, right?

215
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:26,118
(Attendant) Why did he do it for a stranger?
Our food?

216
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,322
If the giant had climbed over the wall anyway

217
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:32,992
eat more
I wish you could reduce it.

218
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:35,027
(Armin) What...
(Eren) Damn it!

219
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:37,763
Ah... Ellen!

220
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:41,533
This is a food shortage.
It's only going to get worse.

221
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,002
(Ellen) Ugh!
(Staff) It's it!

222
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:45,637
What is he doing, you brat?

223
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:48,107
(Ellen) Ugh, ah.

224
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:51,076
Even though I don't know

225
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:54,213
Even though I've never seen you before!

226
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:58,217
How does a giant...

227
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:01,053
shut up!

228
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,254
(Armin) I'm sorry.

229
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:04,690
hungry
Because I was irritated

230
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:08,227
So for adults
Such a rude thing...

231
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:11,262
I'm really sorry.

232
00:17:14,665 --> 00:17:16,035
Geez…

233
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:20,571
You don't have to starve to death.
It's all thanks to us.

234
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:24,675
He's like that even as a kid.
You should have a feeling of gratitude

235
00:17:24,742 --> 00:17:25,778
Yes

236
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:27,413
Damn it

237
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,616
Who will take care of those people?

238
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:35,354
He's going back to Wall Maria

239
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:38,190
Destroy all the giants!

240
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:41,693
Ellen
You're not serious, are you?

241
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:42,728
(Ellen) I'm serious!

242
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:47,599
I'm just trying to stay strong inside the walls
Different from those guys!

243
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:50,102
I don't need him like this!

244
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:52,271
Wow he is!

245
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:54,339
Ellen, I'm going to starve to death.

246
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,775
Don't you regret it?

247
00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:59,845
That's what I've been blessed with.
I can't beat the giant!

248
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:02,281
(Armin) It's impossible, there's no way I can win.

249
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:05,184
we are
I have no choice but to live inside the walls

250
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,420
If you mess up, you'll die.
Like my father and mother

251
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:10,622
So he gave them
Are you going to pekopeko?

252
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:11,824
Aren't you embarrassed?

253
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:14,426
Now... I can't help it now!

254
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,161
It's just an excuse that it can't be helped

255
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:19,465
Then he'll be like that forever
Live like livestock!

256
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:20,365
Wimpy!

257
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:22,835
Ugh!

258
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:26,271
(Armin) Mikasa...

259
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:39,184
(Mikasa) If Armin is a wimp
Ellen and I are the same

260
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:42,788
we can run away from giants
Escape from the city

261
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:45,591
I haven't done anything myself

262
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:49,428
I even received help with food today.

263
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:52,264
A person without such power...

264
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:55,367
that giant
There's no way I can defeat even one of them.

265
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,538
The important thing is to survive

266
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:02,141
As my aunt said

267
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:07,846
(Ellen) Uh... uh...

268
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:09,248
mikasa

269
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:12,518
eat
I'll survive just fine

270
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,853
I won't let Eren starve to death.

271
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:19,691
(Eren's sobs)

272
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:27,666
(Armin) A few days later-

273
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:29,768
large numbers of refugees

274
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:33,872
To secure food
Sent to cultivate wasteland

275
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,777
However, food shortages are inevitable.

276
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:44,883
The following year, in 846, the central government
In the name of retaking Wall Maria

277
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,619
Injected a large number of refugees into the operation

278
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:58,597
250,000 people

279
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:05,804
It was equivalent to 20% of the population
He is one of only a hundred survivors.

280
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:11,443
With that sacrifice
Food shortages for those left behind

281
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,246
slightly improved

282
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:29,428
(Eren) It's all the Titan's fault.

283
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:32,531
If only I could crush them...

284
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:36,335
We can even take back our place

285
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:39,771
aluminum

286
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:42,874
I'm applying to be a training sergeant next year.

287
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:43,809
eh?

288
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,747
Gain strength to fight against giants

289
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:53,819
Me too…

290
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:54,953
Armin…

291
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:56,421
Me too!

292
00:20:57,856 --> 00:20:58,991
(Mikasa) I'll go too.

293
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:02,427
Mikasa...you like him.

294
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,429
It's important to survive
I would have told you

295
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,865
Yes, that's why-

296
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,800
I'm going to keep you from dying

297
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,974
I understand, there are three of him.

298
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:28,754
(Keith) From now on, the 104th season
Holding the training corps induction ceremony

299
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:32,658
I'm unlucky
I will be supervising you.

300
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,026
It's Keith Shardis.

301
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:37,062
I have no intention of welcoming you.

302
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:38,664
You guys now-

303
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:41,833
At best, it can only become food for giants.
just livestock

304
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,735
They are lower than livestock.

305
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:46,638
You guys are of no use to such shit...

306
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:49,408
We spend three years training

307
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:52,377
I'll teach you how to fight giants!

308
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:56,515
Three years from now, when you guys stand in front of the giant

309
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:58,050
Is it just bait?

310
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:02,087
Or protect the king
Will it be a wall of honor?

311
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:06,458
or destroy the giants
A glorious soldier of humanity?

312
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:08,460
You guys decide!

313
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:12,364
(Ellen) Ah, I'll become it.

314
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:16,935
I will exterminate every single titan.
